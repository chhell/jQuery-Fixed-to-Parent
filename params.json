It fixes the target element to the top of the viewport when scrolling down and to the bottom of the viewport when scrolling up.\r\n\r\n    $('#sidebar').fixedToParent();\r\n\r\nThe plugin also provides the following method calls\r\n\r\n    $('#sidebar').fixedToParent('unbind');\r\n    $('#sidebar').fixedToParent('rebind');\r\n\r\nThe first of these unbinds the _scroll_ and _resize_ bindings that the plugin establishes, and the second of these unbinds and rebinds them.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
